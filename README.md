This is a program to take a graph and split it evenly into multiple subgraphs, the point being that large graphs could displayed across multiple pages. It inputs a rigid subset of Graphviz DOT files and outputs to that same rigid subset. It uses a simple pair-swapping hill-climbing algorithm, an algorithm of the simulated annealing category, and a branch and bound algorithm with linear relaxation that will eventually produce optimal results. (Somewhere in 30-40 elements, depending on the page size and edge density, the branch and bound disappears into infinity on my system. I believe the problem is NP-Complete, hence the difficulty of producing optimal results.)

There are a lot of unfinished elements here. Ultimately, Graphviz and characteristics of the data (much of which is stored as sample data) made this feel unproductive; this was no nice neat splits of the data, and Graphviz produces results with enough unnecessarily crossed lines and similar graphical nuisances to make me give up. Some dummy nodes that would let the pages be split in ways that aren't perfectly divisible would be nice; I believe adding too many would make the pages unbalanced, as they would tend to be pushed to one page, but might help make for aesthetically better splits. It might be nice to load real DOT files, instead of the woefully rigid subset I do; perhaps I should take it as an excuse to learn ANTLR or the parser included in Scala's main library. (JSON or XML would be easy but I don't have a need for them and I don't know of any preexisting graph formats in them.) It's possible I will come back and and use Akka to make the branch-and-bound parallel; since it is NP-Complete and GLPK is not reenterant, it would make little practical difference, but would be an excuse to work with Akka. I've thought about writing an all-JVM linear programming library that doesn't have GLPK's headhurting horribly imperative interface. (Part of the reason there's an abstraction layer for GLPK.) That would be a separate project, and I doubt I could make it even approach the efficency of GLPK.

To build, install sbt (Scala Build Tool) and run "sbt compile" in the main directory. I've been running it with `sbt "runMain Cherizo sample_data/movie1910s.dot 13 1910s_pages"`; if you want to run it as a normal program check out http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/DetailedTopics/universal.html . (For testing, that should report that the optimal value is 484 (sum of edges coming from off-page for each node, or twice the number of edges crossing pages) and this copy returns ((0, 3, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 26, 29, 32, 33, 34, 38), (1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 28, 30, 35), (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 23, 24, 27, 31, 36, 37)) for the optimal solution, though there's probably other optimal solutions.

(Yes, the program prints and ignores the linear programming solution for the blank case, so it has to look at the initial subbranches before it realizes that it knows that the annealing already produced an optimal value. A minor bug that's a performance bug in the smallest and simplest problems that it's going to return on nigh-instantly anyway, so not a big concern.)
